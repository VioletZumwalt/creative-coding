        <h2> Class Conclusions</h2>
        This class has taught me a lot aout the nature and usage of coding. While I had some fundamental understanding approaching this subject, I am able to understand far more than I did before. 
    Coding is as complex as any spoken language, and the ability to understand it is something that will take time. While I am not yet at the point where I could confidently look at a script and
    mimic what is being asked of me, I could confidently be able to deduce what is being requested, or be able to connect what causes the end result. Of course, there's plenty I do not understand
    yet, and it will be a while before I do. Very good class in both how it was taught, and what it taught.<br /><br /><br />
