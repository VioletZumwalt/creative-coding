    <h1 class="title" Story Time</h1>
    <p class="content">  I don't have many good stories about real life situations, but I have a great story about a dungeons and dragons.<br>
    See, my issue with the game has always been that I have friends who love to hang out, but they hate one thing....<br>
    Following The Story.<br>
    See, I have always been the dungeon master. This is very difficult when they don't want to follow the story.<br>
    Instead, they explore elsewhere, and make me make up every little thing on the fly.<br>
    The first time we played Dungeons and Dragons, I had them on a path to a castle
    it was surrounded by a large field.<br>
    This field then segmented into a forest, to emphasize this was in the middle of nowhere.<br>
    <i>They decided the forest was where to go</i><br>
    I had ackowledged this. I'm 16, I want to hang out and play my game<br>
    So, in this new campaign, I had bought the book very specifically for it.<br>
    There were cults, there were hand symbols and things the cults did.<br>
    I worked very hard to learn these things, it was boring, but I wanted it to be cool<br>
    So, they made players. A pirate crew! Led by a.. Shirtless dragonborn woman. Okay!<br>
    Within an hour they had left town and kidnapped the head of this cult<br>
    And then they kidnapped a guard member after accidentally ripping his face off<br>
    And then they kidnapped a shop keeper<br>
    and another cultist<br>
    and an elephant<br>
    and another cultist<br>
    an a zombie lady, who the dragonborn married<br>
    and another cultist<br>
    and then they killed the last one because she was rude<br>
    Now, I hear you, I hear you. Hey! Why didn't you stop them?<br>
    Every cultist fight was supposed to kill them. They rolled better<br>
    And they took this campaign so far away, I rushed them to Waterdeep.<br>
    Where I had to use an entirely different Book<br>
    And it was fine! For a while, they followed the book pretty well<br>
    They got to a confrontation point, and I had told them, many<br>
    Many<br>
    <i>Many times</i> <br>
    That pissing off the Xanathar, a gang leader that happened to be a beholder<br>
    Was stupid, especially when working for it, especially at level 3.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>"I could take you on. You're not that tough. I'll be the new Xanathar"<br></i> said the brave, intelligent pirate captain who led every single kidnapping<br> <br><br><br>
    and then she rolled a 20 to kill its goldfish, y'know, the one thing it cares about<br><br><br><br>
